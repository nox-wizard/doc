<h1><a class="anchor" name="p_override">Overrides,events and callbacks</a></h1>Now it's the time to explain how the source code calls a Small function.<br>
 We are not interested in learning how a Small function call is implemented in sources, we only want to know the things a scripter need in order to have it's scripts executed.<br>
 If you are interested in how a Small function call is implemented in C++ refer to the sources documentation.<br>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="callbacks">
Callbacks</a></h2>
A callback is a public Small function that is called by the emulator.<br>
 You can declare/implement the function where you want, but it must be public and included in the scripts, or the emulator won't see it.<br>
 Due to the implementation of Small function calls in sources you don't have control on the parameters the callback takes, so the prototype of a callback is not free (you can't declare a callback as you want) but it's defined by the sources.<br>
 For every NOX feature that requires callbacks you will find documentation on the prototype needed.<br>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="Overrides">
Overrides</a></h2>
Overrides are declared in override.scp and are used to execute custom code wich will extend or bypass the standard source code.<br>
 If you open override.scp you will see there are some sections, identified by [name]. The only sections you have to worry about are: -[skilltargets] -[skills] -[special] -[speech]<p>
other sections are either unused or there is a better way to call your script (with event handlers for example)<br>
 Every section has a specific syntax to declare the override.<br>
 Basically an override says to the emulator: "when this happens, call this function" so this is the first interface between Small and the sources.<br>
 When it comes the time to call a Small function there are 4 different ways to call it, these are called "modes" and are:<ul>
<li>BEFORE: your script is called before the standard source code is executed</li><li>AFTER: the script is called after the source code</li><li>BYPASS: the script is called instead of the source code, it replaces the source code</li><li>FRAME: the script is called both before and after the source code</li></ul>
<p>
Unless otherwise noted, you callback prototype must be: <pre class="fragment"><div>        <span class="keyword">public</span> myfunction(<span class="keyword">const</span> chr)
</div></pre><p>
where <em>chr</em> is the character that triggered the override.<br>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="sectionsusage">
sections usage and syntax</a></h3>
Now let's analyze each section to see how you can use it<p>
<b>section [skilltargets]</b><br>
<p>
in this section you can specify a public function that will be called when the char is targeting something after a skill use (i.e.: anatomy, armslore ecc..) the syntax is:<br>
 <pre class="fragment"><div>        &lt;skillnumber&gt;=&lt;function name&gt;,&lt;mode&gt; 
</div></pre><p>
<ul>
<li>is the number associated with skill, you will find it in small-scripts/skills/constant.sma</li><li>is the name of the public function you want to be called</li><li>is one of the modes explained previously</li></ul>
<p>
example: <pre class="fragment"><div>        4=myArmsloreFunction,BYPASS  <span class="comment">//this will bypass the standard armslore code with your code </span>
</div></pre><p>
<b>section [skills]</b><br>
 Here your specified function will be called when the charactere uses a skill (clicking on the blue button in the skills menu) the syntax is the same as for [skilltargets]<p>
<b>section [special]</b><br>
 Here you can use some special overrides with the following syntax: <pre class="fragment"><div>        &lt;overridetype&gt;=&lt;function&gt;,&lt;mode&gt; 
</div></pre><p>
is one of the following:<ul>
<li>OnStart: fired on server startup, available only as AFTER</li><li>OnLoop: fired on each server cycle, available only as AFTER</li><li>StartChar: fired on character startup, available only as AFTER</li><li>OnLogOut: fired on character logout, available only as BEFORE</li><li>OnExit: fired on clean server shutdown, available only as AFTER</li></ul>
<p>
For OnLoop, OnStart and OnExit overrides the prototype must be: <pre class="fragment"><div>        <span class="keyword">public</span> myfunction()
</div></pre><p>
You will see that some of these overrides are already set, this means that the standard scripts already use them to do something and modifying them will certainly cause some malfunction.<br>
 The right thing to do when you need one of these overrides is to search the standard callback and insert your function call inside the callback.<br>
 You can find the callbacks in scripts-scripts folder, read comments in the file to correctly insert the function call.<br>
<p>
<b>section [speech]</b><br>
 with this override you can execute a script when a character spells a word, the syntax is: <pre class="fragment"><div>        &lt;word&gt;=&lt;function&gt;,BEFORE 
</div></pre>if in the char speech there is the , your function will be called.<h2><a class="anchor" name="eventhandlers">
Event handlers</a></h2>
Event handlers allow you to to extend or bypass the source code in a number of locations, they are a bit more complex to use than overrides, but they are very much more powerful!<br>
 The concept is that a callback will be called when an event happens, an event can be a double click, a character walking over an object, a charcter being attaccked by another and so on, for each of these events you can link to a character or an item a callback with your script, so the main difference with overrides is that event handlers are "personal", they are related to a single object (char or item) while overrides apply to all characters.<br>
 <br>
 There are several ways to link an event to an object, wich way is the best one depends on the situation, you can link the event in:<ul>
<li>XSS definitions</li><li>SECTION NEWBIE</li><li>small code</li></ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="XSSlinking">
XSS definition linking</a></h3>
in the XSS definition of an item or character put a line with the following syntax: <pre class="fragment"><div>        &lt;event&gt; &lt;callback&gt; 
</div></pre><ul>
<li>is one of the available event handlers (like , ) see the file small-scripts/events/constants.sma for the available events</li><li>is the name of the callback</li></ul>
<p>
example: <pre class="fragment"><div>SECTION ITEM $item_anvil_1 
{ 
    ID 0FB0 
    @ONDBLCLICK __blacksmith  <span class="comment">//this will call function __blacksmith when the anvil is double clicked </span>
} 
</div></pre><p>
linking an event handler this way will cause EVERY object created with that script to have the event linked, so in this example every anvil created with that script will call __blacksmith when double clicked<br>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="SECTIONNEWBIElinking">
SECTION NEWBIE linking</a></h3>
In SECTION NEWBIE you can link an avent handler to ALL the new playing characters, this event will be linked to all chars (not NPCs) when they are created, simply add a line similar to the "XSS definition linking" syntax in SECTION NEWBIE in scripts.xss<h3><a class="anchor" name="small_linking">
Small code linking</a></h3>
You can link an event handler to an object at runtime using the following functions in your small code: <pre class="fragment"><div><a class="code" href="group__script__API__character__events.html#ga1">chr_setEventHandler</a>(<span class="keyword">const</span> chr, <span class="keyword">const</span> event, <span class="keyword">const</span> evtype, <span class="keyword">const</span> format[],...) 
<a class="code" href="group__script__API__item.html#ga32">itm_setEventHandler</a>(<span class="keyword">const</span> itm, <span class="keyword">const</span> event, <span class="keyword">const</span> evtype, <span class="keyword">const</span> format[], ...) 
</div></pre><ul>
<li>chr, itm: is the serial of char or item the event will be linked to</li><li>event: is the event to link (EVENT_CHR_ONWALKOVER, EVENT_CHR_ONKILL etc..)</li><li>evtype: is type of the event, can be EVENTTYPE_DYNAMIC or EVENTTYPE_STATIC, the first type of events won't be save in worldsaves, the second will be saved.</li><li>format: is the name of the callback function that will be called when the event is triggered, supports C-like syntax for the format string.</li></ul>
<p>
when you link an event this way the event is linked ONLY to the object (item or char) you passed to the function.<br>
 <br>
 You can get the callback name of an event handler linked to an object with: <pre class="fragment"><div>        <a class="code" href="group__script__API__character__events.html#ga0">chr_getEventHandler</a>(<span class="keyword">const</span> chr, <span class="keyword">const</span> event, handler[]) 
        <a class="code" href="group__script__API__item.html#ga31">itm_getEventHandler</a>(<span class="keyword">const</span> itm,<span class="keyword">const</span> event, handler[]) 
</div></pre><ul>
<li>chr, itm: is the serial of char or item the event is linked to</li><li>event: the event</li><li>handler: a string in wich will be stored the name of the callback</li></ul>
<p>
You can delete an event from an object with: <pre class="fragment"><div>        <a class="code" href="group__script__API__character__events.html#ga2">chr_delEventHandler</a>(<span class="keyword">const</span> chr, <span class="keyword">const</span> event) 
        <a class="code" href="group__script__API__item.html#ga33">itm_delEventHandler</a>(<span class="keyword">const</span> itm, <span class="keyword">const</span> event)
</div></pre><p>
The callback prototype is different for each event, you can find them documented in the EVENT_* constants documentation.<br>
 Usually you can omit some parameters from the callback definition if you know you won't use them, but you can omit only the last parameters.<br>
 I think omitting parameters is not a good practice because it can easily lead to errors, but if necessary you know you can.<br>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="bypassing">
Bypassing</a></h2>
With function <a class="el" href="misc_8api.html#a0">bypass()</a> you can tell the emulator not to execute his source code, this way your callback's code will take place of the source code.<br>
 Bypassing source code is a very powerful feature, but it's dangerous too, if you don't know the server standard behaviour you might cause errors or other problems.<br>
 Usually there are no problems in bypassing, as event handlers are designed to allow bypassing and all vital chacks are usually done before your callback is called, but if you can, always take a look at the source code the first time you bypass an event, of course not all can easily read C++ code so no problem if you can't, but many times is very useful to understand what you can do. 				</TD>
