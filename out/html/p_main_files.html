<h1><a class="anchor" name="p_main_files">Main files</a></h1><h2><a class="anchor" name="overridefiles">
The override.* files</a></h2>
The "scripts\small-scripts" folder contains 3 important files:<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a></li><li>override.scp</li><li>override.amx</li></ul>
<p>
These files are the MOST important files for NOX, you can mess up with other files, but NEVER rename/delete these files (of course you can try, your PC won't explode, but NOX won't start).<br>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="override_sma">
override.sma</a></h3>
<a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a> is the main Small file, NOX only looks into this file when he searches for Small scripts.<br>
 If you open it you will notice that it only contains #include directives ... uh! I forgot to say: I'm assuming you already know Small syntax so you know what an #include is, if you don't, close this page and study Small before continuing.<br>
 <br>
 Welocome back, you now know everything about Small syntax right? ok.<br>
 We were saying that <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a> contains only #includes, there is a reason for this: we want to have scripts oredered in files,every script has is own file and we don't want to mix up things that do not have nothing in common.<br>
 <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a> is used to put all script files together and this is don by including them, so when the compiler parses <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a> it will automatically see all our scripts.<br>
 <br>
 NEVER PUT CODE INTO OVERRIDE.SMA&lt;br&gt; <br>
 Now focus on: <pre class="fragment"><div><span class="preprocessor">        #include "<a class="code" href="myshard_8sma.html">small-scripts/myshard.sma</a>"</span>
</div></pre><p>
This includes the <a class="el" href="myshard_8sma.html">myshard.sma</a> file wich is in the same folder as <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a>, your shard's scripts shoud be included in that file and not in <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a>, the reason is simple: when we update NOX scripts sometimes we modify <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a>, and if you include your scripts there and then update NOX with new scripts you may lost you script's link,this is not that big problem, you can always restore the lost #includes, but if you use <a class="el" href="myshard_8sma.html">myshard.sma</a> you are sure you will never have trouble because that file is never modified.<br>
 So if you created a custom folder for you shards' scripts (and you should have done it),open <a class="el" href="myshard_8sma.html">myshard.sma</a> and include your new folder.<br>
 The final rule is:<br>
 <br>
 NEVER TOUCH OVERRIDE.SMA&lt;br&gt; <br>
 So why did I explain what <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a> is if you must never touch it? It was only to avoid you yelling in the forum: "Hey! I removed override.sma and now nothing works! it's a bug!"<h3><a class="anchor" name="override_scp">
override.scp</a></h3>
In the scripts-scripts there is another file called override.scp.<br>
 This is one of the most important files, and I'm not going to explain it in detail here, there will be another section for this.<br>
 For now just know that override.scp is used to tell the emulator when to call a Small script.<br>
 The fact that I only wrote a few lines on this file doesn't mean it's not important as <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a>, override.scp will be you nightmare for the next few weeks of study!<h3><a class="anchor" name="override_amx">
override.amx</a></h3>
This file is the ONLY important file for NOX, but it's the LESS importatnt file for you, it contains AMX code, you can open it and try to read it, but it's only some kBytes of ASCII nonsense.<br>
 Every time NOX compiles the scripts it creates a new override.amx and overwrites the old one, this file is then loaded and it's code executed.<br>
 NOX can run with only this file in the scripts-scripts folder, without caring of any other .sma file, this means that you can upload only this file on the server and it will run.<br>
 WAIT! Befaore trying it you must tell NOX that you want to use the current override.amx or it will seek for <a class="el" href="override_8sma.html">override.sma</a> and will throw an error if it doesn't find it.<br>
 Open "config\server.cfg" and search: <pre class="fragment"><div>        USEINTERNALCOMPILER 1
</div></pre><p>
and turn it to 0: this deactivates the Small compiler and makes NOX load override.amx without compiling the scripts.<br>
 This feature is useful if you don't want to upload all scripts to the remote server and also speeds up the server startup a lot because scripts compilation is skipped.<br>
