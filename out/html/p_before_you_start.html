<h1><a class="anchor" name="p_before_you_start">Before you start</a></h1>Before you start studying Small scripting you have to prepare the field for the battle, and, mainly, mentally prepare yourself for the task!<h2><a class="anchor" name="folders">
Prepare the folders</a></h2>
All directory paths start from your NOX executable path, so if you installed NOX in c:\ (this is for windows, the same applies on Linux) all paths will start from that point.<br>
 All Small related files are in the "scripts\small-scripts" folder (in our example: c:-scripts).<br>
 The APIs are in scripts-scripts folder, all other subfolders contain standard scripts files.<br>
 You should create a folder where you will put all you shard's Small files, this folder should NOT be in the scripts folder,for example you can create c:.<br>
 This is not mandatory, is only to keep your shard's scripts separated form NOX scripts to avoid messing up with them (especially when you will use CVS).<br>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="fileextensions">
File extensions</a></h2>
This is simple: all Small files have the .sma extension, actually they are only text files.<h2><a class="anchor" name="tools">
Prepare the tools</a></h2>
To edit Small files (.sma) you will need a text editor.<br>
 This is one of the most critical points: the editor can make the difference between an happy scripter and a sad (and potentially dangerous for the society) one.<br>
 As Small files are text files, you can use every text editor you want (Word, Write, notepad) but I strongly suggest you to find an editor that at least supports syntax higlighting (syntax higlighting is a cool feature wich highlight with differnt colors a programming language keywords) and possibly can keep many files open at the same time and with powerful search-replace features.<br>
 In windows environment the answer to all these needs is UltraEdit32: it's a shareware software you can download and try for 45 days, search it on the web.<br>
 I'm not much into linux so I can't suggest similar programs.<br>
 Of course you can use any program you want, but trust me, scripting in black and white can drive you crazy in a very short time!<h2><a class="anchor" name="howtostudy">
How to study NOX</a></h2>
Nowyou have the basics for having NOX runnning and you know what you should never do, also you know Small syntax (right?) and potentially you can script for a NOX based Shard.<br>
 Of course you still have a lot of work to do if you want to script decent features for your shard.<br>
 I wrote this docs to teach you how to do things but surely you will have a doubt that finds no answer here, in this case do what old scripters did when there wasn't any documentation: ask in the forum!<br>
 Expert scripters and staff members always answer to questions and common questions will be put into the documentation, BUT read docs before asking! Please do not ask things that are already explained in docs and read previous posts before submitting a new one, maybe someone else already askied what you need.<br>
 This is for not having the forum stuffed with the same questions over and over.<br>
 Another point is that, as all things, your knowledge will come from experience so don't be scared if you make the server crash or if your script does not work, it's normal.<br>
 When you are skilled enough to understand others' code you can take a look at standard scripts, they are usually a bit complicated (sometimes terribly complicated) but there you can learn how to use APIs and how to do high level scripts: standard scripts are a big example of NOX scripting so they are the best place to look for solutions to your problems.<br>
 You can choose to be a DIY NOX scripter and to rely on your forces only, wothout any documentations aid, this can be because feel skilled enough to learn all by yourself or because you are too lazy to read all these pages,in these cases you'll probably learn NOX nut it will take much more time because some things are really hard to learn adn this docs will warn you when there is a thing you should pay particular attention on.<br>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="mentalinsanity">
Mental insanity</a></h2>
NOX has a particular feature, not really documented but always present: it easily causes mental insanity.<br>
 If you find yourself yelling against the computer at 2 o'clock in the night with blood injected eyes saying things like "I hate you!" "This MUST work!" "I hate Fax and all dev team!" (and other not repeatible things) ... well ... you have been infected ... and this means that you will probably become a good NOX scripter :-)<br>
