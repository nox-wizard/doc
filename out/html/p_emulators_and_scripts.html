<h1><a class="anchor" name="p_emulators_and_scripts">Emulators and scripts</a></h1>This page is for those who never heard about emulators and absolutely don't know what scripting is, so if you feel you already know this concepts, you can skip this page.<br>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="emulators">
Emulators</a></h2>
This is not a complete explanation on emulators, and you won't find here what emulator is better for you, here I'll only explain the concept of "emulator".<br>
 Ultima Online is a product of OSI (Origin Systems Inc) and you can play it buying UO and creating an account on OSI servers.<br>
 The problem is that you have to pay for an OSI account, paying for the account you receive professional ingame support and professional programmer staff who fixes bugs.<br>
 UO shards (a shard is a server running UO) exist because someone wrote a program that, running on a server, makes the people able to use their UO client to play Ultima Online on that server, <b>without having an OSI account</b>, that is, withoum payment.<br>
 This program is called "emulator".<br>
 To make a new shard you simply have to download an emulator (they are all free), put in on a server, make it run, and wait for players to connect and play on your UO world.<br>
 This ease of use is the cause of the huge number if free shards there are all over the world.<br>
 You will ask: why free shard are all so different from OSI and from each other shard?<br>
 The answer comes in the next chapter.<h2><a class="anchor" name="scripting">
Scripting</a></h2>
As I said, an emulator allows you to have a shard on your server, but in its base configuration emulators usually perform as an OSI UO world, or at least they try to.<br>
 If emulators weren't customizable by shard admins, there will problably be an only emulator and an only huge free shard (many people drem of this ;-))<br>
 "Customization" is the key word for every emulator, wich means, you can modify the emulator behaviour (and then the game) so you have your personal shard, with your personal version of UO running.<br>
 To achieve this, emulators usually offer a scripting language to modify some of the emulator's parts.<br>
 A scripting language is not a programming language (you can't write standalone programs with it), and every emulator has a different one, basing on the customizations it allows to the user.<br>
 The scripting language is one of the base things to take in consideration when choosing an emulator: a too difficult may need expert coders to be used, a too simple one may not allow complex algorithms and so may not fit your needs; this is why there are different emulators, each one has his scripting language and is suitable for different shard needs. 				</TD>
